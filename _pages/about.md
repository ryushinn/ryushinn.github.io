Hi there, my name is Chen!

Currently I am a MSc Computer Graphics Vision and Imaging (CGVI) student at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), and working on Meta-Learned Appearance Modelling supervised by Prof. [Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/).
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree of Computer Science from [Beihang University](https://buaa.edu.cn/). During my undergrad, I interned at Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/)'s Lab for months, and worked at ByteDance as a graphics engine intern.

I am a graphics enthusiast who aspire to create a world satiating our childish sense of grand adventures.
List a few things that really fascinate me: photorealistic rendering, appearance modelling, and data-driven image synthesis.

<!-- TODO: include research interests and the vision. -->
<!-- TODO: the philosophy where my vision comes and which I believe  -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
