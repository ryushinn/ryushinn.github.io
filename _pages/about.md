Hi there, my name is Chen! :)

I am now a Computer Graphics PhD student at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), working with Prof. [Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/) and Prof. [Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/N.Mitra/).
Before that, I had a Master from UCL and obtained my Bachelor from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/). During my undergrad, I interned at Prof. [Xianglong Liu](https://xlliu-beihang.github.io/)'s Lab and worked at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) as a graphics engineer.

Talking about research aspirations, my goal is to create a world satiating our "childish sense" of grand adventures. Here is a list of topics that shape the core of my works and interests: Appearance Modelling, Photorealistic Rendering, Data-driven Image Synthesis, and many others more -- AI, of course.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
