# A guide for myself, or for you

I hope I am an expert on web development, but I am not unfortunately. However, I still want to build a pretty personal page --- this page is the one I have achieved so far.

The problem is: I am so poor in remembering all those necessary details to maintain this page as pretty as always. So I write this guide for myself, or for you, in case that you are interested in referring to or forking [the source of this page](https://github.com/ryushinn/ryushinn.github.io/tree/master) to make your own site (under MIT license).

> This guide might be regularly updated if I have new ideas or touch new knowledge about the front-end development.

## Foundation: Jekyll and al-folio

Basically, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) is an awesome generator for static sites. It **compiles** your content and styles which are provided in formats of Markdown, CSS, or HTML, into deployable HTML sites.

Most importantly, Publishing content by Jekyll is a perfect workflow for academic pages: you only need to focus on the content itself and the rest of trifles could be settled by your predefined styles and the Jekyll engine.

Jekyll owns a set of rules to generate sites, same as many other compilers, which however are not more than so-called templates (and their grammars), layouts, and configurations. Check following documents to get familiar with these rules:

- [Jekyll Doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/02-liquid/)
- [Jekyll directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)

Moreover, this site is built with [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme which provides great layouts and features to start, but has been modified a lot to fit my needs.
Look at [Appendix](#appendix) to gain a rough idea about core components.

## Goal

Some good examples of scholar webpages:

- [Prof. Ling-Qi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/#)
- [Prof. Wenzel Jakob](https://rgl.epfl.ch/)
- [Prof. Shuang Zhao](https://shuangz.com/)

Essentially, I want to keep my site informative, compact, and good-looking. So I aim for three features, which are listed and elaborated below.

## Feature 1: About in one page

## Feature 2: Publications

## Feature 3: Blogs
